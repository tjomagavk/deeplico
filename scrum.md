## Scrum artifacts

1) We have 3 artifacts:
    - product backlog
    - sprint backlog
    - increment with your definition of “done”(sprint goal)


Product backlog is primary list of tasks. It contains stories, tasks, features, bugs, requirements, improvements and etc.. list. Tasks for the sprint backlog are compiled from it. The owner periodically changes the priority. It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do”

Sprint backlog is the list of tasks that developers take on in the sprint. Planning is done before each sprint. Sptint backlog can be fixed or changed in during sprint but changes can't interfere with the achievement of sprint goal.
Sprint goal is a ready-to-use product following the results of a sprint. Every week team shows increment. Team demonstrates what they've done for the sprint.





## Scrum ceremonies

1) 5 main parts of work:
    - pre-planning
    - planning
    - demonstration
    - daily meetup
    - retrospective




3) Meetings and ???
    - pre-planning and grooming (organize the backlog)
    - planning of sprint
    - sprint
    - daily meetup (stand up)
    - sprint review (optional)
    - retrospective (optional)

Grooming:
Owner and team leader saws product backlog and changes priority for tasks or declined tasks.
Pre-planning:
Owner and team leader review the stories, add descriptions, changes priority and choose sprint goal.
Sprint planning:
Team leader or owner say sprint goal. Team reviews and evaluates tasks. After evaluates tasks or after plannig team leader look max story-points that team can take to sprint and add tasks by priority. After that team leader would meet with owner and we check list of tasks in the sprint. If need they will change tasks in the sprint and will start sprint.
Sprint:
2 week that team will make sprint goal.
Daily meetup:
Everyday meeting for developer. It is during until 15 minutes. Each people answer for 3 questions:
1) What did I do yesterday?
2) What do I plan to do today?
3) Are there any obstacles?
Sprint review:
At the end of the sprint, team get together to view a demo of sprint goal. The team shows all tasks from sprint that are "Done" for feedback.
Owner can decide whether or not to release the increment. Max timeline for sprint review - 2 hours.
Retrospective:
Team is meeting after finished sprint and they discus what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies.
