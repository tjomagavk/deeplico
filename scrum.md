# Scrum

## Scrum artifacts

We have 3 artifacts:

- product backlog
- sprint backlog
- increment with your definition of “done”(sprint goal)

### Product backlog

Product backlog is **primary** list of tasks.
It contains stories, tasks, features, bugs, requirements, improvements, etc..
Tasks for the sprint backlog are compiled from it.
Product owner periodically changes the priority.
It is, essentially, the team’s “To Do”

### Sprint backlog

Sprint backlog is the list of tasks that developers take on in the sprint.
Planning is done before each sprint.
Sprint backlog can be fixed or changed in during sprint but changes can't interfere with the achievement of sprint goal.

### Sprint goal

Sprint goal is a ready-to-use product following the results of a sprint.
Every week team shows increment.
Team demonstrates what they've done for the sprint.

## Scrum meetings and ceremonies

6 main ceremonies of work:

- sprint pre-planning and backlog grooming (organize the backlog)
- sprint planning
- sprint
- daily meetup (stand up)
- sprint review (optional)
- retrospective (optional)

### Organize the backlog

#### Backlog grooming

Product owner and team leader saws product backlog and changes priority for tasks or declined tasks.

#### Sprint pre-planning

Product owner and team leader review the stories, add descriptions, changes priority and choose sprint goal.

### Sprint planning

Team leader or product owner say sprint goal.
Team reviews and evaluates tasks.
After evaluates tasks or after planning team leader look max story-points that team can take to sprint and add tasks by priority.
After that team leader would meet with product owner. They check list of tasks in the sprint.
If need they will change tasks in the sprint and will start sprint.

### Sprint

2 week that team will make sprint goal.

### Daily meetup

Everyday meeting for developer. It is during until 15 minutes. Each people answer for 3 questions:

- What did I do yesterday?
- What do I plan to do today?
- Are there any obstacles?

### Sprint review

At the end of the sprint, team get together to view a demo of sprint goal.
The team shows all tasks from sprint that are "Done" for feedback.
Product owner can decide whether to release the increment or not
Max timeline for sprint review - 2 hours.

### Retrospective

Team is meeting after the sprint ends and discusses what worked and what didn't work in the sprint,
in a project, relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies.
